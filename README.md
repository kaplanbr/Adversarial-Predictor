# Adversarial Predictor Procedure
This is a python application of monte carlo simulations based, 2-stage algorithm idea that provide a "more dependable" (see description pdf) confidence metrics for any discriminative classifier.

Below is a visual of results from logistic regression, gaussian process classifier and adversarial predictor with logistic regression as base classifier. "Versicolor" and "Virginica" are fed to model for training and predictions for "Setosa" samples are analyzed. See pdf file for details.
